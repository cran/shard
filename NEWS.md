# shard 0.2.0

Internal performance and correctness refactor. No user-facing API was removed;
apart from a new `path=` argument to `as_shared()` and the deprecation of the
unused `pool_create(heartbeat_interval=)`, all changes improve the behavior,
speed, or robustness of the existing runtime.

## Performance

* Overhauled the task-dispatch core: the worker function and diagnostics setup
  are now exported once per dispatch instead of per task, and run-level
  diagnostics are gated behind `diagnostics = TRUE`. This sharply reduces
  dispatch wall-clock and task-payload size on many-shard workloads.
* The internal task queue uses an O(1) claim cursor with batched claims.
* Non-contiguous (strided) shard index sets are compacted on the wire and
  reconstructed in the worker, cutting serialization cost for sparse selections.
* On Linux, `backing = "auto"` now maps shared memory on tmpfs; added
  `madvise()` access hints and a cached segment base pointer.
* Buffer sparse (non-contiguous) reads and writes use typed C gather/scatter
  instead of a full read-modify-write, while bulk contiguous sub-block writes
  keep their fast path.
* Contiguous buffer reads (`buf[]`, `as.vector(buf)`, per-shard slice reads)
  now use a single typed C read instead of a raw intermediate plus `readBin()`,
  halving allocation and copy volume when materializing results.
* Master-side chunk-queue management is O(1) per chunk (cursor-based dequeue,
  preallocated completion storage); completed chunks retain only minimal
  metadata by default, releasing shard descriptors as the run progresses.
* Worker liveness probes reuse a `ps` handle cached at spawn time (also more
  robust against PID reuse) instead of creating one per check per poll tick.
* Buffer index validation and contiguity detection are allocation-free and
  preserve ALTREP-compact index ranges.
* Indexing a buffer with 3 or more dimensions now gathers/scatters only the
  selection instead of materializing the whole buffer; array assignment no
  longer breaks the lock-free disjoint parallel-write guarantee.
* The online autotuner and `stream_map()` no longer grow result lists
  incrementally across phases/partitions.

## Reproducibility and correctness

* `seed=` now installs an independent per-shard L'Ecuyer-CMRG RNG stream
  immediately before each shard runs, so results are identical regardless of
  `workers`, `chunk_size`, or shard-to-worker assignment, and are stable across
  worker recycling and restarts.
* `cow = "deny"` is enforced for shared inputs at the R level; deep-environment
  validation for shared objects is preserved.
* C layer: corrected long-vector handling (`XLENGTH`), Windows read-only
  segment protection, and copy/coercion accounting.
* `view_col_vars()` and the `col_vars` kernel use a numerically stable (Welford)
  computation.
* `shard_map()` validates `borrow`/`out` names against the worker function's
  formals before creating the pool, failing fast with a clearer message.
* `shard_reduce()`: minimal reducer environment, per-shard seed streams, and
  corrected automatic chunking and `init` semantics.
* Worker recycling replays a bootstrap manifest so borrowed inputs and outputs
  are correctly re-exported to restarted workers.
* Fixed an integer overflow that broke `share()` for atomic vectors over 2GB
  (about 269 million doubles).
* Fixed `shard_reduce()` receiving a stale output-buffer handle when run after
  `shard_map()` on the same pool with a same-named `out=` buffer.
* C layer hardening: shared-memory offset/length validation is overflow-safe
  (negative or non-finite values now error cleanly instead of reading or
  writing out of bounds), freshly created ALTREP objects are protected from
  garbage collection during construction, shard ALTREP methods no longer
  misidentify other packages' ALTREP objects, and the shared task queue
  validates its header before use.
* `table_write()` validates `shard_id`, so an NA id can no longer produce a
  part file that `table_finalize()` silently drops.
* Fixed `row_layout()` erroring when a trailing shard has zero rows, and
  `shard_crossprod()` failing on matrices with fewer than 8 columns.
* Worker liveness detection no longer reports dead workers as alive on systems
  without the `ps` package.
* On macOS, the `"shm"` backing now works: generated segment names previously
  exceeded the Darwin name-length limit, so `shm_open()` always failed.
* `shard_map(health_check_interval=)` is honoured when supplied explicitly
  (profile presets no longer override it), and `share(name=)` now applies to
  fast-path atomic shares. `pool_create(heartbeat_interval=)` is deprecated:
  it was never consulted (health checks are per-chunk, not time-based).

## Autotuning and configuration

* `autotune_block_size()` now clamps correctly to `max_shards_per_worker` and
  warns when a scratch budget would require more shards than allowed.
* The default worker count can be overridden with `options(shard.workers = N)`
  or the `SHARD_WORKERS` environment variable (still capped to 2 under
  `R CMD check`).

## Testing

* Substantially expanded unit-test coverage of buffers, views, tables, kernels,
  and internal helpers.

# shard 0.1.1

* Fixed a gcc-UBSAN report: the task-queue header used a C89 `tasks[1]`
  trailing-array idiom; changed to a C99 flexible array member.
* Default worker counts now respect `_R_CHECK_LIMIT_CORES_` and are capped at
  2 during `R CMD check`, at all call sites (`pool_create()`, `shard_map()`,
  `shards()`, `shard_reduce()`).

# shard 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN release.
* Deterministic, zero-copy parallel execution runtime for R.
* Shared-memory and memory-mapped segment support for large inputs.
* Worker pool with controlled recycling to mitigate memory drift.
* Diagnostics for peak memory usage, memory return, and copy-on-write events.
* `shard_map()` and `shard_reduce()` for parallel map and reduce operations.
* Arena-based pre-allocated output buffers.
* Support for POSIX shared memory and file-backed memory-mapped segments.
